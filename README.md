## Overview  

LLM-DetectAIve is a system designed for fine-grained MGT detection. It is aims to classify texts from a variety of topics into four categories: human-written, machine-generated, machine-written machine-humanized, and human-written machine-polished.

LLM-DetectAIve can effectively identify the authorship of textual content, proving its usefulness in enhancing integrity in education, academia, and other domains. LLM-DetectAIve is publicly accessible on hugging face

## Demo Interface

The demonstration for LLM-DetectAIve has two tabs

### 1. Automatic Text Detection
![Demo Interface 2](assets/Interface1.png)

    
Lets the user input any text (> 50 words) to get a prediction from LLM-DetectAIve.


### 2. Human Detector Playground

![Demo Interface 2](assets/Interface2.png)

Lets the user see if they can correctly label data given a random sample text.

## Data Generated

Across LLMs over the four classes:  
I. Human-Written  
II. Machine-Generated  
III. Machine-Written Machine-Humanized  
IV. Human-Written Machine-Polished

For row II + III + IV, the data is approximately uniformly distributed across the three classes.
